# Databases of zeolitic structures

The goal of this repository is to serve as stable hosting (mirror) for some existing databases of zeolitic structures, created by colleagues, whose websites have recently become unreachable. I am trying to host them here, in a stable version, to allow others to use them and reproduce previous work on the topic.

I do not own any rights to these structures, but as their authors originally shared them publicly, I believe it is the right thing to do. They were, in most cases, published without explicit licences attached to them. 

## Michael Deem's databases

Originally hosted on http://www.mwdeem.rice.edu/files/ and http://www.hypotheticalzeolites.net/DATABASE/DEEM/index.php but as of September 2020, none of these websites are reachable.

- I have mirrored the original database files on Zenodo: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.4030232](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4030232), exactly as downloaded on 14 September 2013: `pcod_new.zip` and `pcod2_new.zip`
- The [`pcod`](pcod/) directory contains all CIF files from `pcod_new.zip`
- The [`pcod2`](pcod2/) directory contains all CIF files from `pcod2_new.zip`
- The [`Deem_known_zeolites`](Deem_known_zeolites/) directory contains 181 structures of known zeolites, optimised under the same conditions.
